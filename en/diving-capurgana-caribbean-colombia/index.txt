Capurganà located along the Caribbean Sea in Colombia, has one of the few pristine reefs in the world, this is confirmed by its inclusion as a new protected area and marine national park, each dive site stands out for the richness and diversity of its coral reef. This allows a number of reef species find refuge and home in their growth cycle.

In your dives you will see a variety of corals and fish, almost all of those who inhabit the Caribbean Sea; highlights include: Surgeons, French Angel, nurse sharks, turtles, rays. lobsters, octopus and more.


We have about more than 30 [dive sites] (sitios.html) each with different characteristics and also our proximity to the region of San Blas Panama allows us to enjoy diving in this area.

Enjoys our warm waters maintaining excellent visibility most of the year!
